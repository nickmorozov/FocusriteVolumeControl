Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts section: currently app says f13/14/15 are used as shortcuts but it's system volume control and mute, right? by default system vol+-/mute should be used with options to override and reset - preferences: input to set the custom shortcut with a button to reset to the right of input. available shortcuts are: volume up, volume down, mute, direct control (unset by default).
add an option to choose which approach to use - FC server or FC app via applescript (first option will noot work for now)
add button to restart server/app manually (depending on what's chosen)
option to start on sys startup
option to restart server automatically if connection is lost
shortcuts to switch presets and change inputs volume, with e.g., shift or control + volume

=== Known Issues ===
- Mute button causes popover to shift a few pixels when menu bar is set to "Always Hidden". This appears to be a macOS/SwiftUI interaction issue with auto-hiding menu bars and popover repositioning.
