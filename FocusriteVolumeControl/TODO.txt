=== Roadmap ===
Focusrite Control Protocol/Server support
    Option to restart server automatically if connection is lost
Shortcuts to switch presets and change inputs volume, with e.g., shift or control + volume

=== Known Issues ===
- Mute button causes popover to shift a few pixels when menu bar is set to "Always Hidden". This appears to be a macOS/SwiftUI interaction issue with auto-hiding menu bars and popover repositioning.
- Mute button causes popover to shift to the left edge of the screen if Menubar is Hidden.
- Increment value does not correspond to db changed.
