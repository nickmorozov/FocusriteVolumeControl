[DONE] Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts section: by default system vol+-/mute are used with options to override and reset. Available shortcuts: volume up, volume down, mute, direct monitor.
add an option to choose which approach to use - FC server or FC app via applescript (first option will noot work for now)
add button to restart server/app manually (depending on what's chosen)
option to start on sys startup

=== Roadmap ===
Focusrite Control Protocol/Server support
    Option to restart server automatically if connection is lost
Shortcuts to switch presets and change inputs volume, with e.g., shift or control + volume

=== Known Issues ===
- Mute button causes popover to shift a few pixels when menu bar is set to "Always Hidden". This appears to be a macOS/SwiftUI interaction issue with auto-hiding menu bars and popover repositioning.
